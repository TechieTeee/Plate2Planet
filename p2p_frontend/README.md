## Inspiration
Did you know that a staggering 2.5 billion tons of food is squandered annually worldwide? Shockingly, this contributes to over 10% of greenhouse gas emissions, as recently reported by a PLOS publication. Even more appalling is the $2.6 trillion dollars in economic, social, and resource lost each year, in the U.S. alone. Meanwhile, countless families suffer from hunger while valuable food goes to waste. According to the United Nations, over 828 million people are currently impacted by global hunger, and the aftermath of COVID has only exacerbated this crisis.

Motivated by these alarming facts, Plate2Planet was created as an innovative, data-driven, and blockchain-powered solution. The mission is simple yet powerful: to rescue food before it's wasted and provide crucial, transparent data to the public, all through a cutting-edge blockchain platform. Together, we can combat food waste, nourish the hungry, and create a brighter future for all. Join in this vital journey towards sustainability and social responsibility. Together, we can make a lasting difference. Let's power up for change with Plate2Planet!
